341|we got into fights over small things and started talking less.|0
1331|I may x-post to psychology as well.|0
1904|Does that even exist?|0
1176|"
* When I'm not on Adderall, I have -zero- motivation and energy."|0
307|I was in my kitchen making myself something, when I think I see something move out of the corner of my eye.|1
1463|"
Edit: Are there any successful daily activites or exercisers that worked for you."|0
286|"

    I've always been somewhat depressive, but I have only realized this recently, and have been doing things to empower myself, and I can say that i'm sorta happy at this point."|0
359|But, I started to notice something strange.|1
1024|I didn't really know much details before I met her and I didn't know the extent of her illness and didn't know about her hallucinations she had prior to taking the injections.|0
432|It appears to be a government complex.|0
927|My entire life these were blown off by my parents (and I could never even tell anyone about the last one) and didn't even see a therapist until age 17.|0
1743|I don't have these as often but when I do I just blame my body and not my brain.|0
313|" 
  
Oh I forgot to add that prior to this event I experienced a slight worsening of my paranoia and delusions, but I had them completely under control and wasn't worried as they tend to variate a little bit all the time."|1
1378|And I know that mental illness does not make you who you are.|0
311|I asked him if I should ask my doc what he thinks since the guy is his affiliate and he said I could.|0
1374|He hasn't gone into the details as to why, but while he was in there he attempted suicide.|0
1296|I used to believe I used to be articulate, but I can't tell anymore.|0
1477|After a while of not being shot, it gets to the point where you can assess situation and realise that these thoughts are either a little bit strange or that the people trying to kill me are some of the worst hitmen in history (they never took a shot but c'mon, surely they would've at some point if this was real).|1
1720|He would tell me not to eat lunch because it was poisoned and I would seriously consider disposing of it (although I would force myself to eat it because a part of me *did* suspect it was bull).|0
1057|But I'm afraid of myself.|0
822|"

Ok, so I'm 17, almost 18, male."|0
511|Sometimes it will have a name depending on the conversation, but it's always the same presence.|0
422|I've only ever had one of those before this and it wasn't quite that bad.|0
563|I have been on anti psychotics since and therefore do not know if I am truly schizophrenic...|0
334|Not sure if that has anything to do with it, but I really felt like his mental capacity was always 7 years behind.|0
857|"
Oddly enough, I am not very paranoid, and I don't seem to suffer from my condition outside of the fact that I've never been in a relationship due to it (which causes me pain, although it is at least partially my fault) and I just can't seem to get anything done."|1
362| As in, I'll think I'll see a black figure standing in my peripheral vision at the end of the hall, go closer to it, and then I won't see it anymore.|1
29|It kind of shocked me...I understand I most likely experience Manic and Depressive episodes...But Schizophrenia?|0
1872|"
I over-interpret non-verbal behaviors of other people, rather than under-interpret."|0
980|I hate talking about it, because I feel like it is not severe enough (because it doesn't harm my life) and makes me feel selfish.|0
1675|She insists I do though.|0
691|I am not a violent person nor did I make any threats to myself or others.|0
907|However, the constant fear of the disease has had me questioning everything that I'm doing.|1
477|"I realize that I am not some miracle cure all, and I know that I can't ""fix"" him."|0
473|Hi all.|0
177|Also somehow she's the only one who can feel this electric and vibrations.|0
1268|It doesn't matter if I look nice, everyone always looks better.|0
1574|He was also VERY into conspiracy theories, maybe even obsessed.|1
1125|I hope it helps, did it help with any of you guys?|0
1233|It really scares me even though I know- and keep telling myself over and over again- that there's nothing to be afraid of.|1
1384|"

I think this is related to me being sexually abused as a child."|0
1023|So, if I am going to consult one first, I'd like to at least know if people diagnosed think my listed symptoms sound like those of schizophrenia or not.|0
1656|"
Advice/thoughts would be greatly appreciated."|0
1031|You can imagine my parents concern when the cops turned up on their doorstep at 4am in the morning looking for me.|0
835|I finally erupted into a panic last night after work.|1
553|Upon attending class, I was arrested by campus police and the FBI, which had a search warrant for my house and car.|0
1438| That's probably one of the worst things, to me, because it's true.|0
897|"
The reason I say all this NOW is because my boyfriend is getting help for his depression (yay for him!) and it made me think about this diagnosis and everything and wonder if anyone else has denial about it."|0
1606|I guess I just don't know what to do or where to go or who to talk to.|0
134|I never really had any adverse effects from this, however.|0
1812|I want to go back to school, I want to work.|0
1888|I started doing research and found schizophrenia to have the most common denominator, with possible schizoaffective being more accurate.|0
1493|They want me to think they like me so that maybe I'll finally kill myself when they all tell me to fuck off.|0
1179|**Healthy Release**.|0
733|I will also forget things I just read, or forget important events.|1
1567|I will admit, there have been a few times i've been told that I was totally out of it(Which I don't even remember) But most of the time I do feel that I know what is going on.|0
1565|Also, I am happily married.|0
1680|"
Thanks!"|0
1466|but that's not unusual for this disorder.|0
1837|" 

Anyway, what type of medication should I use if I have access to pharmaceuticals through my research lab?"|0
1784|"
Ha, also the same number everywhere, this sucks."|0
159|If I'm not angry I'm content.|0
237|I was wrong.|0
367|I took him to the hospital when he became more agitated, but they couldn't keep him there against his will as he wasn't threatening violence or self-harm.|0
185|(I won't delve too far into this story, but he's always been a bit of a drama queen.) He has been extremely stressful to be around and I am already struggling with the pressures of school and my own personal troubles, so to put it nicely, I've been blowing off hanging out with him so that I can avoid dealing with the emotional stress he puts me through.|0
224|"

Are there any successful daily activites or therapy experience you can share that I might be able to recreate to help my husband?"|0
584|"I'm trying to see a neurologist and a psychiatrist soon, but until then it would be nice to have feedback from others :)

Edit: Oh, and if this makes a difference, my dad is Type I Bipolar."|0
124|"
Hallucinations

This is also more of an issue at night, but generally I hear a lot of sounds that no one else does."|1
878|He has also mentioned he is afraid to ever own a gun because of what he might do.|1
1300|I'll give you guys some background on what has me thinking about schizophrenia recently.|0
1621|I had a melt down and quit.|0
1454|All the while I still made a half way functional student, although a major burden to the team members in all my classes.|0
693|I spend most of my time browsing reddit and gaming (not really enjoying it), almost everything else is a chore and very challenging.|0
860|Be interested in social activity again?|0
161|But now it only makes me more solipsistic or antisocial.|1
1833|I have been tentatively diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and my doctor told me to try and find an online support group.|0
1241|"


If I try to speak, it comes out wrong, or my thoughts stick."|1
719|Instead of going there, I call up a good friend or family member, maybe play online with them on a video game, or talk to them on the phone.|0
309|"It got even worse when I would hear deep whispers saying ""Hey!"" or ""Over here!"" from behind me and I'd turn around to no one being there."|1
1863|Except for the nausea.|0
379|But they didn't interfere with my life much, I instead thought it was more or less a superpower.|0
1945|These are all true.|1
1721|I really appreciate it if you've read this far.|0
933|I'm paranoid that my family and friends hate me and are constantly talking behind me back.|1
1351|I have crammed as much info as I can on schizophrenia, well enough to know when he's having the most trouble.|0
1411|I've even stayed at a facility for a couple of weeks.|0
872| I don't know how to effectively get across that some things are hurting me when they could all be in my head.|1
338|With the internet being as popular as it is, more and more mental illnesses seem to be arising.|0
1089|I smoke weed, I know my chances of schizophrenia are increased if he has it, should I stop?|0
1133|So if you'll be patient with me, can someone clear up some misconceptions and give ELI5 examples and answers?|0
1763|I plan on seeing him at some point this weekend.|0
1555|Anyway, Snorlax got better over the years, reacting far more calmly to situations, etc.|0
889|How long before you were diagnosed and how did that come about?|0
825|I felt like my conscious voice was turning on me, it no longer agreed with me and tried to convince me to kill myself.|1
495|I was relieved, but disappointed in myself.|0
133|Past conversations, future conversations...what i should have said...what i said...etc.|0
1805| I think people are covering up for the university or wsb or the police or all three.|0
1165|"
But recently I feel like it's too good to be true."|0
1977|"Now I notice an increase in, let's call it ""not rational thoughts""."|0
1486|We became very close, we started talking every day.|0
236|I worry that shes going to end up in the hospital all summer which is really unfortunate.|0
842|I have a history of trauma and abuse.|0
1506| But these are lifelong problems.|0
1755|"
So right now she's in the hospital and I need some advice on what to do or what I can do to help."|0
524|But, at the same time, this is a large part of who I am, and I would like to be able to talk to them about it.|0
1491|All of his previous points of stress, depression, and anxiety are worse now than they were before.|0
1826|" Same goes for traditionally schizophrenic thoughts such as ""people are following me all the time"" when I see a sign or something that indicates surveillance on premises."|1
559|He left the program, bought a bus ticket down to the town he had been living in and left without saying a word.|0
887|I am so sad, though.|0
135|"
Anyway, I have no thoughts, self, memory, reality, pleasure, and have been diagnosed with schizophrenia at least three times."|0
755|As it stands, he just drinks himself to sleep every night, spastifying himself in front of the tv, ignoring his life, getting government funding, all of which he spends on shit like ipads, mobile phones and alcohol and cigarettes.|0
1177|"

3."|0
619|At least three a night,sometimes.|0
1375|After being off for quite some time, I have not experienced anything as radical.|0
637|"

About 5 years ago, one of my closest friends was diagnosed with schizophrenia."|0
974|That's been my schedule for most of the past 7 years.|0
1370|"
Lastly, all I can say is this."|0
35|" Same with other ""voices"", just in much shorter bursts and occasionally they can be heard when I plug my ears, but faintly."|0
1796|3 hot meals every day, and quite a bit of freedom.|0
465|What kind of tests did you take?|0
880|I've read a few articles that say that stimulant psychosis can occur at therapeutic doses, and that it's actually harmless.|0
21|While she was in the hospital they started her on a new medication and she seemed to feel a lot better on this new drug.|0
283|He doesnt recall sending weird text messages to his friends, or his friends coming to look for him.|0
712|And lots of shadows looming over my bed in the pitch black.|1
713|I am 19 years old, female, and have noticed these things develop over time.|0
23|"
Like I said, I am not schizophrenic."|0
250| Extremely rarely (like once or twice) I'll see something head on, but it's only for a split second, and it is usually indistinct.|1
1277|I'm seeing completely different realities than what should be real.|1
585| Shit like that makes me freak out and resist those thoughts.|1
1585|"

Another thing is I've been paying a ton of attention to little ""quirks"" my mother and I share."|0
1865|My last doctor put me on ambien, which was horrible.|0
546|I actually remember excitement as I lifted into the air.|0
1237|i struggle to find meaning.|0
886|I am unusually brave as I stare down the man, and he attempts to strike me up with a deal.|0
527|I think I can handle it, but I also think it will be a battle that only ends same time as I do.|1
1479|Hi, some thoughts I've been having.|0
616|This helps me not stress out over the less frequent Hallucinations and focus just on life.|1
1761|There were hidden cameras installed in my house to observe me, yes, but I could live with it.|1
1587|With the combination of mispronounced words and confusing sentences, I tend to have to repeat myself a lot.|1
112|"
Alex also asked the strangest questions, like “If dinosaurs existed, and then you made them macaroni and cheese, would they light on fire?” Questions that made absolutely no sense at all."|0
1032|I have never been formally diagnosed Schizophrenic...|0
1144|I didn't even spend a night in the place yet hospital staff think it's warranted to call the police.|0
531|"

My possible schizophrenic activity began around the same time but I believed I was just coping in my own way."|1
831|The other day I was holding a newborn that I work with.|0
645|Especially my mother.|0
1726|" 
I don't know what I'm expecting from this post, but maybe some of you were in a similar position and could help me out with tips on how to handle this matter, as the atmosphere at home becomes more and more toxic and I alone am blamed for it."|0
201|I did tell him about my convo with my doc because it bothered me, it was so serious of him to say with not a lot of information and I respect him after seeing him for over 3 years.|0
172|The day he got discharged after 5 days from the 1st hospital, he ran into busy street, stood still and cars tried dodging him to avoid hitting him so he got sent back by the police.|0
1520|no positive symptoms really, but the negatives one were much apparent.|0
996|She sometimes has delusions that her loved ones are out to get her, evil, or supernatural creatures in human skin, so she has a lot of trouble trusting those who are close to her.|1
700|I have 2 weeks worth of medication but after that I'm out.|0
648|I'd ask the goers of this subreddit if I have it, but, of course, it wouldn't be official.|0
1568|"Hey everyone,

Maybe I'm in the wrong place for this, but I've exhausted my options really."|0
634|The Seroquel made the kind voices silent, removed the cameras in my house and made me stop thinking the DEA was using agents to tail me everywhere I went.|1
13|Totally unable to articulate.|1
1717| I could've SWORN I saw a white blur with a leg running by.|0
1519|No special hairstyles.|0

I do have hallucinations, but usually they are minor."|1

It seems like now you can't point out even the basic acts of weird, irrational, rude behaviour that he engages in, otherwise he just blanks you and cuts you out of his life until he gets lonely and calls you back up."|0

THEN."|0
1670|Apparently they're looking to change that.|0
385|I've only been diagnosed for around 1-2 years, but I've been writing about things I think about for almost a decade.|1
424|My husband wanted to talk to a woman, this woman is also a PA which he didn't like but after I gave him more info on a PA he is more willing and does like that she is female as the doc set for next week is male.|0
267|Thoughts are incoherent at best, stampeding at worst.|1
561|He stated how I had walked in on them multiple times, stated, “this is too weird,” and let it go on (This most certainly did NOT happen).|0
1509|okay.|0
241|The result is a book called 'Big Hearts, Broken Minds'.|0
794|This thought scares the shit out of me.|0
209|I begged him to visit a psychiatrist, not just his therapist.|0
178|I do personally believe my diagnosis was for insurance purposes but it currently stands as Paranoid type Schizophrenic with comorbid OCD and a leaning tendency toward catatonic schizophrenic.|0
2028|Alex has lived with his mom for the last year.|0
577|My brother, who is diagnosed with Schizophrenia, was recently prescribed Oxytocin nasal spray.|0
1845|He quizez me on what I mean.|0
1336|However, I have always been rather independent of my family, both emotionally and financially, so I only visit once every three or four months (mostly holidays).|0
60|I think I've suffered from hallucinations my whole life and just learned to adapt to it.|1
1657|My brother was ran over by a gravel truck in January of 2004(he was 16 I was 10) and my mom started having me go to child psychologists/therapists to help me cope.|0
1235|I miss society..|0
441|I want to help him so much, but I don't know where to start.|0
106|So I am guessing that there is some reason besides just reduced ability to regulate impulses that make the scope of nicotine addiction so widespread among people with schizophrenia.|0
1044|What can I do to be there for him?|0
815|Sometimes I get very angry with people for touching me.|1
1498|"However my parents don't see the amount of effort it takes me to do even these minimal tasks, and are saying I'm being lazy and constantly telling me to ""pull myself together"" and start being more active."|0
566| The FAQ needs to be updated, as well, and maybe we could add a few other links to NAMI and other various outlets (I am on my phone, currently, so if anyone has any good links, please share!) so that those looking for answers about their current state have a more professional answer.|0
1529| Then she said there is no god that it was someone else talking to her.|0
1913|He's my best friend and I just want him to be okay.|0
34|Saw a black dog walking through my hall one morning.|0
92|Maybe I'm just sick of being in a constant state of panic and paranoia.|0
410|Since then, I've told two of my friends about it.|0
578|"
Anyway, the point of this post is to warn you that if you should ever have a psychotic episode as I did back in 2011, do not contact any of the crisis teams."|0
1911|I apologize in advance if this is the wrong sub for this kinda thing, and also for the wall of text I’m about to post.|0
827|Like hoarders are to keeping things as she is to caring for pets.|0

i guess what i'm asking is.."|0
500|I won't go into detail because nothing you say is a secret on the internet.|0
1825|I'm going to try this because I don't really know where else to go.|0
316|"

 I kicked my car window out and may have broken my hand punching my car about a month ago."|0

739|I don't know if she's just got too much stress, or if there is something else going on here.|0
791|And if I should tell them, how?|0
998|I also have a history of anxiety and depression with the anxiety being the main focus here.|0
1505|"Here's My story:

I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia about less than a year ago but I've experienced delusions a ton throughout my life."|1

728|Even though it's not touching me, it's in my head.|0
118|My mother is diagnosed with schizophrenia undifferentiated.|0
1978|During the day, all I see are small fractals of my dreams, colors, words.|1
522|I don't particularly want to treat him differently than before, I want to make him feel like its still the same between us, but I want to know if there's anything I should know about communicating effectively with someone who has schizophrenia.|0

1948|A few years ago I was diagnosed as having depression, I'm currently taking Remeron and Risperidone.|0
885|I just wanted your opinion on what's happening to my brain.|0
950|Don't set yourself up.|0
1168|It's not all here.|0
472|He kept telling me how much he liked me, but his parents honestly wouldn't budge at all.|0
1510|Sometimes It's okay to believe it's real.|0
145|I'm majoring in psychology (ironic), and I'm trying to become a government-type psych employee, psych researcher, or medical school.|0
706|After a while he stopped talking to me, but for years afterward, I would at least believe he was a lone individual stalking to kill me for reasons only known to him.|1
75|What can we do?|0
223|why should i try?|0
2032|I'm fine typing, but whenever I try to talk about this sort of thing I just freeze up and don't know what to say.|0
1599|His parents would not let him go out with any friends, let alone a date to the movies.|0
567|"
So during my middle school my mother stopped working for some reason and really wasn't taking care of herself well at all."|0
836|When anyone does something like that, I will -never- do it again.|0
1769|So I empathize with him, pity him and also at the same think that he's being a selfish asshole, and my sympathy runs out.|0
102|"
January 2009 was an awful month."|0
306|If you have any questions about what exactly this process entails, please just ask!|0
1976|Wikipedia calls it flat affect.|0

Now for the last two weeks I've stayed away from all stimulants, including nicotine and coffee, but I don't seem to be getting any better."|0

390|It you want to make your problems worse, smoke weed.|0
1004|Regular talks with my Girlfriend's superstitious mom leads me to believe I can see the dead and demons.|1
1063|As in I cannot picture myself getting married, or holding a baby of my own.|0
1250|When she was released she only took the medication for a couple days and stopped.|0
904|ALSO; I'm already involved with CAMHS because of my anxiety, but frankly...|0
1998|maybe i just don't know how to let go.|0
444|I don't know whether this would make sense if it were schizophrenia.|0
1435|Doors slamming or closing as well.|0
1496|"

And I know that sounds crazy, my roommate has informed me of that and I get it."|0
1762|When I'm in a depressive state the paranoia is severe.|0
1708|I have been mentally since an unlikely trauma at ten but could handle it and enjoy things till 25, at which point I died.|0
231|They just don't offer any kind of drug or alcohol help and refuse to deal with it in patients.|0
604|I quit seeing my counselor, and I'm afraid of my psychiatrist.|1
948|I thought i had it, something i could feel good about, finally.|0
936|like the last few years I have kind of had this paranoia..|0
1348|As far as I know, once the medications were changed the voices and the misinterpreting decreased.|1
1377| I don't know.|0
206|The past few months were getting a little worse, waking up and staring at people standing over me, or waking up with a person sleeping next to me, just now I thought someone was standing next to me and now they're gone.|1
1086|"
So my problem is because of all the laws we have an incredibly difficult time getting her early intervention or help."|0
346|Sort of like a 6th sense type of deal.|0
724|This can be really hard when delusions tie into it but sometimes it's possible to walk past and ignore everything around you.|0
150|"

So in short, major symptoms I show are 
*paranoia to a degree
*I tend to go off on tangents/have disorganized or unassociated thoughts
*I tend to be forgetful
*insomnia, although this could be due to my ADHD medication
*I read somewhere that ""movement is sped up."|1

1647|This is not self-diagnosis.|0
984|"At the time I had believed I had some sort of multiple personality disorder because there were two voices that seemed to distinguish themselves with certain personalities and they would ""take over"" and do what they did."|0

406|In my experience, the positive symptoms go away rather quickly as soon as antipsychotics are administered.|0

1197|He's been experimenting with drugs since he hit puberty, and it'd always caused lots of trouble within our family.|0
470|I'm not sure how else to describe it :/ I haven't heard any voices or had any visual hallucinations but I have such a hard time sleeping and feel like I'm always hungover; I have a weird sense of vertigo and dizziness and the pressure in my brain usually changes to a throbbing by the end of the day.|1

At ten I came home from playing soccer and washed down with the cold shower attachment (we didn't have a real shower)."|0

I scared myself yesterday."|0
1074|Hello everyone!|0
128|Someone posted a question in /r/Aspergers a while ago asking if it was possible to have both autism and schizophrenia.|0
1634|"

I liked to play with emotions."|0
911|In short, whats the basic understanding people should have about someone diagnosed with schizophrenia?|0
1200|For example, I'd want to work on my homework but I felt I had to email one famous guy in my field with my elaborate theories and had delusions of grandeur that I was going to be his succesor.|0
447|Also, I should mention that his mom is bi-polar.|0
570|Going back and forth but I want to stop fighting everyone so hard because it really makes me struggle.|0
1776|Needless to say when working for 5 hours each day in that room it got pretty intense.|0
1997|That lasted for a few days.|0
104|I was under the belief that I was spying on a Chinese intelligence cartel attempting to compromise military research secrets from the University and I was selling out their activities to the Mossad.|0
901|I'm still high, but also intensely sad.|1
351|There is a lot more to autism than that, but most people like to think of it in very simple terms.|0
819|There is a possibility it wasn't a hallucination, since people were standing outside my cube talking to another member of the team who has the same first name.|1
786|Hi everyone, I'm just looking for some insight.|0
925|He says he has the precursors to schizophrenia.|0
1524|It's not an animal.|0
688|At my friend's house the other night, I had said goodbye literally just to my one friend and ignored every other person.|1
179|" She even brought her cleaning lady along as a ""witness"" and said terrible things to her friends."|0
437|"
- Girlfriend and I hit off swimmingly, but a new issue developed in early March; crowds became a huge problem."|0
1428|When I started researching it I saw more and more things both in my earlier life and in my treatment that fit into this self diagnosis.|0
1642|"
Turns out her uncle was diagnosed schizophrenic and she was cleared medically."|0
429|Before this, I had friends take me to the ER for spacing out.|0
249|Rats on the ceiling when I'm laying in bed.|1
621|"
a true caveat here, blessed with great genetics.."|0
1935|I sprayed my genitals with ice-cold water and my penis -- which had been growing normally -- shrank absolutely tiny, I panicked to say the least, and it never went back to normal and I didn't go through puberty.|0
1352|It means a lot to me.|0
1216|"

I don't know why I'm doing this and I'm honestly scared shitless that somehow I'm actually lying and someone is going to find out and report me and they'll lock me away."|0
320|"
""Look, even if you leave me this isn't over."|0
735|My reactions obtuse, I am terminally chill.|1

1326|I am in no way ever going to abandon my sweet man in what has presented itself to be his highest time of need.|0
855|I got to spend this Thanksgiving with family and I'm happy for that, a couple years back I spent Thanksgiving in the psychiatric wing of my local hospital...|0
1951|I have definitely had delusions which have led to hospitalizations.|0
650|But I felt so much in danger that I didn't go back to my desk for a while.|1
291|"
I laugh and talk to myself quite a bit."|1
1207|It goes away moderately quickly, and I usually even forget that it happens until I am reminded at a later time.|0
1308|Why should I or shouldn't I?|0
301|There's only so many excuses I can make for the guy in other people's company.|0
519| Within 24 hours of being admitted and on whatever medication they had her on she began to come out of it, feel extreme regret at stopping her medication and was very apologetic.|0
377|I talk, to the point of full conversations, in my sleep.|1
1824|Or am I just experiencing psychotic features from Bi-Polar disorder/Depression...|0
865|"

Lately he's been the worse."|0
659|"That is ""when a person has no ability to persist in an activity."" It basically ""looks like an extreme lack of motivation."" As you can probably guess, I am not happy with this."|0
1602| This has happened many, many times.|0
68|Due to this, I've never really accomplished much or have had a full-time job, and I'm 29.|0
548|This leads to behaviors that are dangerous to her well-being, like taking a long walk (hours) late at night (past midnight), which can't be stopped without physically restraining her.|1
635|By extreme I mean, peeking outside the window curtain anytime I hear sirens thinking they're coming for me.|1
736|I should have had me tested but I was scared of the outcome...|0
811|" 

2)  The ""hallucinations""."|0
1770|Should I keep bringing up the medication or just let it drop?|0
1354|"


Eventually, I have a nap, and when I wake up it's gone."|0
1492|For example, while in my boss's office, I glanced at his keyboard and was reminded of an event where I was in pre-school, building computer keyboards on the floor.|0
1120|"  
2.) I get extremely paranoid when I'm alone."|1
1135|I cannot simply walk away when she needs to feel as secure as she possibly can.|0

1480|The book tells the story of how he fell in-love on a psychiatric ward, whilst detailing the horrors of medication addiction and severe mental illness.|0
1937|With several posts about hallucinations and schizophrenia-related topics gracing the front page in the past few weeks, I've noticed a lot of comments that REALLY bother me.|0
1499|"
So my question is, is it normal for schizophrenia to deteriorate like this after so many years?"|0
4|"
Edit: Well I will fail my exams when they come soon"|0
1254|My son is 7 and was diagnosed earlier this year with pediatric onset schizophrenia.|0
416|"
P.S. I've been to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with anxiety, along with the 3 other GPs I've been to."|0
360|I have locked myself in my room (live in a dormitory) for days with the lights off.|1
698| I am also questioning if some of my thinking is delusional, when it clearly isn't, but I still feel the need to question.|1
1663| I've seen a few things like a dog and a little girl, but I wouldn't have known they weren't there if someone didn't tell me.|1
171| But these are lifelong problems.|0
1696|I'm 22 and I've been hearing voice since last year in December and I'm sick.|1

These hallucinations scare me."|1
1327|I always seem to make a friend, and then within a few weeks I lose that friend.|0
1916|"My thoughts speed up and I can see things inside my head that threaten to creep out, like my thoughts are leaking into ""reality""."|1
1248|This is her life, and she needs support.|0
756|First, she told everyone she thinks she is god.|1
490|When people ask me to explain my thoughts or what I mean, I feel like theyre testing me.|1
1609|"
 
Does this.."|0
803|Is this because it brings on hallucinations?|0
1037|I should jump off that building/bridge.|0
1134|What I did is a pretty good reason to be upset at me.|0
1881|But over the past few years, I am completely socially isolated.|1
595|I suspect he is not sharing his beliefs with his therapist.|0
1523|So many dreams.|1
776|I would like to introduce a character who is just beginning to experience schizophrenic symptoms (in a respectful, educational way).|0
89|everyone else's, he could become dangerous.|0
1850|I was so excited, i posted the news on facebook, thinking i had finally found something i was passionate about, something that may be difficult, but because i loved it so much, my mind would keep the thoughts at bay.|0
951|I love music.|0
54|Even if modern science has a primitive understanding of the human brain, at least know this is not fairies and magic.|0
493|But I didn't focus on them at all.|0
255|he's becoming more and more into these theories, and less attached to reality.|0
1709|Break your arm, show it to 10 doctors and you'll have a consensus.|0
965|This has been on my mind for a while, but everytime I bring it up to other people, either in real life or online, it almost always gets shut down.|0
462|"

Does anyone have any advice?"|0
1804|since I could have just been experiencing temporary psychosis from the chemicals.|0
990|" The urine/blood tests came out as ""normal"" so the doctors called me delusional and diagnosed me with schizophrenia."|0

*Edit"|0
1317|However, this medication makes me super tired all day, which is very hard to combine with my full time study.|0
516|She said she felt this way since she was born.|0

1562|Most people have a hard time keeping up with me.|0

1415|Eventually she felt like she couldn't live there anymore and left to stay with a family member.|0
36|I don't know if he is hearing the voices again or what, he really doesn't seem to want to talk about it (and I respect that).|0
894|If I do that, it gets much worse.|0
530|i have a childhood friend lets call her stacy.|0
127|I am a rational individual and when I have had delusions, I've been able to step back through them while being objective until it made sense that these things could not possibly be true.|0

Well, I will repsond to any comments next week."|0
1730|Yep.|0

About a year ago, my psychiatrist told me that I experience quasi psychosis."|0
780|"
Now I'm stuck with the fact that I've got memories of the last couple years that aren't real, and I'm missing others that are."|1

Thanks."|0

1986|" He recently opened up to me a bit more about what ""goes on up there"" so he says."|0
456|I'm sick.|0
866|I'm a 22 y/o male, im at the end of my rope.|0
1355|That leaves me 10 times more vulnerable than the average person.|0
2033|But, my new community mental health center doctor doesn't believe it could be schizophrenia because she hasn't personally witnessed negative symptoms in the 15-30 minutes we spend together.|0
1591|A fair amount of schizophrenics were also developmentally delayed growing up; while this would make a misdiagnosis of autism more understandable, it really should be said that being developmentally delayed alone does not make a person autistic.|0
775|Story sort of dates back a long time.|0
1304| She began acting strange (kind of mean) a couple weeks back.|0
1306|But I can't feel them.|0

303|" 

Whilst writing this, back in my early days of anxiety after taking drugs, I remember seeing in the distance a chimney on a roof or something that looked like it could have been a person standing on a roof, and I was really made anxious by it."|1

607|My own, not other people.|0
1403|These are all things you can avoid to not even put yourself in that situation.|0
141|He was miserable, alone, stressed, depressed, and socially anxious almost constantly for too long, always feeling like an outsider (mostly due to poor family and woman circumstances).|1
1262|She didn't explain and I didn't asks.|0
1870|I'm almost constantly driving people away because I'm turning more jaded, cynical, and paranoid.|0
914|Even with people I like, including my boyfriend, I'm just at a loss of words when society seems to think I NEED to say more.|1
1462|are these just normal things that come with the illness or is it just myself and really has nothing to do with the voices, extreme paranoia, and my other feelings..|1
1274|When we found out and asked her, she said she was waiting for my mom or my sister to come pick her up.|0
1661|He said that someone else who was working there was undergoing similar experiences, with that in his mind he said that he thought it was demons.|1
544|Honestly, this is the first time I've been sober since hearing about it.|1
1478|The thing is, though, is that most people (laymen and professionals alike) only care about the surface behaviors and also don't quite care about how two disorders technically contradict each other, so as such they are more than happy to say that someone can have both.|0
525|I really hope I'm not offending anyone because I've never been officially diagnosed and I'm not trying to say that I am definitely schizophrenic or anything like that.|0
1083|"
So far I think he only has a stereotypical idea, and he's really headstrong so whenever I try to argue that I do infact have it, he always brings something up that will counter it in a subjective way, and he's kind of letting his personal views get in the way of factual evidence that it does indeed exist."|0
1942|I am diagnosed with a mood disorder, but it was never specified which.|0

Thanks for an advice in advanced."|0
46|"

I realize that I can be paranoid."|0
957|I am not a doctor.|0

The fact that i'm so concerned about it seems like it would be impossible because i'm too in touch with reality."|0

**tl;dr  my brother has schizophrenia,1."|0
404|"

I don't know what I'm asking."|0

I am almost 24 years old."|0

Personally I manage day to day life by myself, but I'm almost always painfully aware that I'm bored and have a hard time concentrating."|0

771|And also a few days ago when I had stayed up 3 straight days but my therapist and I agree that was from sleep deprivation.|0
1418|It is sort of hard to do things in logical order; I usually talk about one thing and then after a minute or so I say something totally unrelated, at least to the other person.|1
1280|"
I live in FL, and as far as my family can discern, there is nothing illegal about being psychotic."|0
1239|My question is...|0
663|My point is, how the hell does she think I have schizophrenia when I've never had unexplainable hallucinations?!|0
1231|Pleasant dreams become less and less prevalent.|1
1993|"I only refer it to ""progress"" is because as soon as he is released and back with my mom and I, he stops taking his medicine eventually."|0
1995|The scent will persist until I physically move myself or heavily distract myself (fall asleep, etc) and it is usually extremely strong.|0
402| We had to force her to the hospital but at this point we thought her electrolytes were out of whack or something medical was going on.|0
869|She's been diagnosed with clinical depression &amp; social anxiety.|0
1293|I remember laying on the couch as a kid and having full-blown all-immersive delusions play out in front of my eyes.|0
1718|But I just want to be there for him and help him in any way possible.|0
940|She might actually want one but it could also just be part of the disease.|0
1257|It doesn't look like there is anything of concern but at least it ruled out implants (this is a fucking joke, a little levity huh?!).|0
1578|" It is good for us to discuss symptoms, but it we have to remember that telling someone they ""sound"" like they have schizophrenia can be harmful to them."|0
1402|I can't let them catch up with me.|0
796|My psychiatrist said it's by taking my meds, and maybe that's right.|0
779|"
I have a horrible memory."|0
372|I'm assuming that if we admit her to a psych ward, there would be no waiting list (like housing).|0

UPDATE: I've had some time to think about all the comments you guys have posted."|0

We’ve always known there was something a little off about my younger stepbrother."|0

I love philosophy and pure mathematics, but don't understand the logical systems behind them very well, or really any logical system for that matter."|0

70|I feel like in every room there is hidden camera and wires etc, but logically I KNOW it is not true!|1

On a final note, I know my parents are stressed out too."|0

I'm seeing and hearing more things that aren't there, I'm becoming far *far* more paranoid, I'm making up memories and really believing they happend, and recently sleep has been horrible because of vivid nightmares and sleep paralysis (though I don't know if that has anything to do with any possible schizophrenia it just seemed mention-worthy)."|1
891|"
In late 2010 I began seeing people and things for extended periods of time."|0

So, in closing, I ask that all of you, before you go on to say someone ""sounds"" like they may have schizophrenia, tell them, instead, that only a doctor can give them the help that they need."|0
